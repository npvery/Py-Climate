# Py-Climate
Long-term project to pull and analyze climate data.

Things we'll need:
  Good data source with several features (location, temperature, CO2 levels, proxy for industrial development of country [GDP, size of manufacturing sector], year, etc.)
    - Possibly pull in NPS data - https://irma.nps.gov/DataStore/Reference/Profile/2221882 
  Tool to pull that data from online source
